# 🛡️ HimRakshak - Real-Time Disaster Monitoring System

HimRakshak is a real-time disaster detection and monitoring system built with React.js, Node.js, MongoDB, and Express. It simulates and visualizes sensor data such as **movement (acceleration, gyroscope)** and **weather (temperature, humidity, pressure, altitude)** to detect early signs of **landslides, structural collapses, or extreme weather** conditions.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔴 **Real-time simulation** of sensor data (Accel, Gyro, Pressure, etc.)
- 📊 **Live graphs** to visualize historical sensor trends
- ⚠️ **Instant alerts** on abnormal conditions (e.g., high movement, low pressure)
- 💾 **MongoDB integration** for logging and analytics
- 🌐 Backend built using **Node.js & Express**
- ⚛️ Frontend using **React.js**
- 📡 Easy extension for real sensor integration (e.g., IoT devices)
